# Yakshi: A Transmedia Narrative Exploration

At Smart Story Labs, we are excited to announce a new GitHub project that dives into the transmedia narrative of Yakshi – reimagining this South Asian folklore spirit as a lens to explore cross-cultural storytelling, feminist hauntings, and ecological narratives.

In Kerala folklore, Yakshi is a tree-dwelling spirit, a beautiful yet fearsome figure tied to nature, desire, and justice. Yet Yakshi is not alone. Across cultures, we find her kin:
🪐 The Greek Sirens who lure with song,
🪶 The Slavic Rusalka bound to water and betrayal,
💧 The Japanese Onryo seeking vengeance,
🌊 The Latin American La Llorona, weeping across rivers.

Through this project, we ask:
✨ What happens when these stories migrate and remix across diasporas and media platforms?
✨ How do we reclaim “dangerous femininity” through folklore?
✨ How can these archetypes shape speculative climate storytelling and feminist design futures?

We will explore:
Story frameworks and visual mythologies for XR and gaming.
Narrative mechanics connecting place, memory, and feminine power.
GitHub-based open collaboration for artists, designers, and researchers to contribute culturally grounded expansions.

If you’re interested in transmedia design, folklore studies, game narratives, or speculative futures, we invite you to follow our progress, contribute, and remix with us.
Let’s explore how Yakshi can guide us into stories that are as wild, powerful, and liminal as she is.
